# Random test-case generator
---------------------------


Description
-----------

As the name suggests, it is a simple random test case generator. I built it because I needed some test cases to check my algorithms. Currently, it supports following modules:-
- **List of random numbers of specified size** :- 
    - Integer type
    - Double type

I have planned to include following modules to it:-
- **Graphs with specified number of vertices and edges** (different combinations of following properties) :-
    - Connected 
    - Disconnected
    - Edges with different cost
    - Directed
    - Undirected
- **Generate public pastebin link**


Usage
-----

Following are the list of commands required to run the application :-

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siddharthgoel88/RandomTestCaseGenerator.git
cd RandomTestCaseGenerator
chmod a+x run.sh
sh ./run.sh
```

Requirements
------------
- Java JDK 1.7 and above
